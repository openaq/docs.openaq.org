The HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed status code indicates that the server
understands the request method but refuses to fulfill it. In the context of the
OpenAQ API, this error is encountered when you attempt to use an HTTP method
other than [GET](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/GET).
Any attempt to use other methods, such as POST, PUT, DELETE, or PATCH, to
interact with endpoints will result in a 405 Method Not Allowed error.

A 405 response is the correct server behavior when unsupported HTTP methods are
used, the API is properly enforcing its read-only design. This indicates a
client-side method selection issue rather than a server issue.

## How to Resolve

Change your request method to HTTP [GET](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/GET).
The OpenAQ API only supports GET requests for retrieving data and does not accept
methods designed for creating, updating, or deleting resources.
