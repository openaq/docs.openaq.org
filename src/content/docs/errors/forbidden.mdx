description: Learn about the HTTP 403 Forbidden status code and how to solve common causes of this error in the OpenAQ API.

The HTTP 403 Forbidden status code indicates that server understood the request
but is refusing to authorize access to the requested resource. This status code
is most likely an indicator that the user account or IP address of the requester
has been blocked due to a violation of the OpenAQ platform [Terms of use](/about/terms)
or rate limit abuse.

A 403 response is the correct server behavior when access is legitimately
restricted. The OpenAQ API is properly enforcing access controls and usage
policies. This indicates an authorization issue rather than a server malfunction.


## How to Resolve

403 restrictions due to policy violations or account suspensions will not be
automatically lifted and require manual intervention. Contact dev@openaq.org to
resolve the issue, providing details about your use case and recent API
activity.
