The HTTP 401 Unauthorized status code indicates that the request lacks valid
authentication credentials. This means either no API key was provided, the API
key is invalid, expired, or the authentication header is malformed. Access to
the requested resource requires proper authentication in the form of an 
OpenAQ [API key](/using-the-api/api-key).

## How to Resolve

A 401 response is the correct server behavior when authentication fails, the
OpenAQ API is properly protecting resources that require a valid API key. This
is a client-side authentication issue rather than a server malfunction.

Verify that you are including a valid API key in your request in the
`X-API-Key` header and that it is properly formatted in the authentication
header. If you don't have an API key, you must to register for one through
the [OpenAQ Explorer](https://explore.openaq.org).

### Common issues

- **Missing API key**: No authentication credentials were provided in the
request, ensure you include your API key in the `X-API-Key` request header
- **Invalid API key format**: The API key may be malformed, truncated, or
contain invalid characters. Verify you copied the complete key correctly
- **Incorrect header format**: The authentication header may be improperly
formatted - ensure you're using the correct header name `X-API-Key`
- **Revoked credentials**: Your API key may have been revoked due to terms of 
use violations, check your OpenAQ account for notifications
