The HTTP 408 Request Timeout status code indicates that the server understands 
the request method but has timed out waiting for the request to complete. This
typically occurs when queries are too broad or request large datasets.

<Aside type="caution" title="Warning" >
Repeated request timeouts may result in a temporary suspension for overutilizing
resources. Plan requests to be mindful of the API rate limits and query
complexity.

## How to Resolve

Request timeouts are not server errors but rather indicate that your query is
too resource-intensive or broad for the server to complete within the allocated
time limit. The OpenAQ API is functioning correctly by preventing queries that
would consume excessive resources and impact performance for other users.

To resolve timeout issues, refine your query parameters to be more specific and
request smaller datasets. Consider breaking large requests into smaller, more
targeted queries or adding filters to reduce the scope of data being retrieved.

### Common issues

- **Overly broad time ranges**: Requesting data spanning months or years without
sufficient temporal filtering may cause timeouts, try narrowing the date range.
- **Complex aggregation queries**: Requests involving heavy data processing may
timeout - consider using pre-aggregated endpoints when available
- **Insufficient query parameters**: Very general queries without specific
filters may timeout due to querying a very large amount of results.
