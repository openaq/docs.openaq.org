# HTTP 404 Not Found

The HTTP 404 Not Found status code indicates that the server cannot find the
requested resource. This means either the endpoint URL is incorrect, or the
specific resource identifier (such as a location ID, measurement ID, or parameter ID)
does not exist in the OpenAQ database.

A 404 response is the correct behavior to indicating that a requested resource
simply does not exist. This is a client-side issue rather than a system
malfunction. the OpenAQ API is functioning properly by accurately reporting the
non-existence of the requested resource.

## How to Resolve

Check that the resource endpoint requested is in fact a valid endpoint as listed
in the API reference documentation. 

If the endpoint is a valid resource endpoint and a 404 Not Found is returned,
the specific resource ID may not exist. Double check the resource identifier and
verify it exists in the system.

### Common issues

- **Incorrect endpoint URL**: Verify the endpoint path matches the API documentation exactly, including correct spelling and capitalization
- **Invalid resource ID**: The resource identifier may not exist or may have been removed from the system
- **Missing API version**: Verify you are including the correct API version in your request path i.e. `/v3/`
