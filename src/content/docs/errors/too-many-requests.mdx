The HTTP 429 Too Many Requests status code indicates that the client has sent
too many requests in a given amount of time. The OpenAQ API has rate limits to
ensure fair access and prevent abuse. When you exceed these limits, the server
will respond with an HTTP 429 error.

The rate limits for the OpenAQ API are quite generous, but it's important to be
mindful of your request frequency, especially when running automated scripts or
applications. If you receive a 429 error, it means you have temporarily been
blocked from making further requests for a set period. Read more about rate
limits in the [Rate limits](/using-the-api/rate-limits) section of this site.

<Aside type="caution" title="Warning" >
Exceeding API rate limits repeatedly can lead to either a temporary
or permanent ban from the OpenAQ API. To maintain uninterrupted access, plan
your API requests carefully.

## How to Resolve

<Aside type="note" >
OpenAQ provides official libraries in Python and R which help handle more complex
aspects of the API automatically, including rate limiting. If working in Python 
of R, the official libraries are the recommended option for best practices. 
Learn more about the libraries in the [Libaries](/using-the-api/libraries) page.

### Utilize rate limit headers

To resolve a 429 Too Many Requests error and prevent it from happening again,
implement a strategy to manage request frequency. The OpenAQ API provides [HTTP
header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers) with 
most responses that contain information on current API rate limit status. These
headers contain information such as current number of requests used in the rate
limit period, remaining requests in the rate limit period, and time until rate
limit period resets. Read more about rate limit headers on the [Rate limit](/using-the-api/rate-limits#rate-limit-headers)
page. 

### Consider a Higher Rate Limit 

If your usage is consistently exceeding the general use rate limits and you have
a need for a higher volume of requests, you can contact the OpenAQ team to
discuss a custom rate limit.
