The HTTP 410 Gone status code indicates that the requested resource existed
previously but has been permanently removed and is no longer available. This
status code is returned when attempting to access OpenAQ API version 1 or
version 2 endpoints, all of which were retired in January 2025 and are no longer
available.

A 410 response is the correct server behavior when resources have been
permanently removed. The OpenAQ API is properly indicating that the requested
endpoint no longer exists and will not return. This is different from a [404 
error](/errors/not-found) in that it confirms the resource did previously exist.

<Aside type="caution" title="Warning" >
Repeated requests to retired endpoints may result in an account suspension or
permanent ban. Only request valid API version resources.
</Aside>

## How to Resolve

Migrate your code to use OpenAQ API version 3 endpoints, as documented in the
API reference documentation.
