The Locations resource in the OpenAQ API provides details about air quality
monitoring stations, including their name, geographic coordinates, and time zone
information. It also identifies the responsible organization (when known) and
data provider. Each location measures various parameters and provides
information on the sensors, including whether the station is mobile or
stationary, and whether the station is actively monitoring air quality.
Licensing and attribution details clarify data usage rights.

## Purpose and Use

The Locations resource helps users find air quality stations in specific areas
and understand details about the station, from what instrumentation it uses and
which pollutants are measured to who runs the station and owns the data. This
allows for analysis and appropriate use of the data.

## Key fields

- id: a unique identifier for each location.
- name: the name of the station.
- country: the country where the station operates, including its ISO 3166-1
  alpha 2 code and name. See the [Countries](countries) resource page for more
  information.
- provider: the organization or individual that facilitates the sharing of data.
  See the [Providers](providers) resource for more information.
- owner: the organization or individual responsible for the station. See the
  [Owners](owners) resource page for more information.
- coordinates: the geographic position, WGS84 latitude and longitude, of the
  station. For mobile locations, this is the first geographic point measured.
- instruments: a list of devices used at the location. See the
  [Instruments](instruments) resource for more information.
- sensors: a list of sensors that measure pollutants, including the parameter
  measured. See the [Sensors](sensors) resource for more information.
- licenses: a list of licenses, with attribution information and a time period
  that each license covers. See the License resource for more information.
- timezone:
