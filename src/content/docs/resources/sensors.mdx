The Sensors resource in the OpenAQ API provides details about individual air
quality sensors that collect environmental data. Each sensor tracks a single
parameter, such as air pollutant measurements or related measurements (e.g.,
temperature and humidity) and reports on their concentration over time.

## Purpose and Use

The Sensors resource allows users to gain insights into the specific sensors
used for collecting air quality data. By viewing sensor details, users can
analyze time coverage and better understand the data’s reliability.

## Key Fields

- id: a unique identifier for each sensor.
- name: The name of the sensor.
- parameter: Information about the parameter measured, including the pollutant
  name , units , and display name. See the [Parameters](parameters) resource
  page for more information.
- datetimeFirst: The datetime of the first measurement available in OpenAQ from
  the sensor, provided in UTC and local time See
  [Dates, times and timezones](using-the-api/dates-datetimes) for more
  information.
- datetimeLast: The datetime of the last measurement available in OpenAQ from
  the sensor. See [Dates, times and timezones](using-the-api/dates-datetimes)
  for more information.
- coverage: Includes details about data completeness, such as the expected
  number of measurements, actual counts, and the time period the data spans.
- latest: The most recent recorded value and corresponding geographical
  coordinates (latitude and longitude). See the [Latest](latest) resource page
  for more information.
- summary: Statistical summary about the values across the lifetime of the
  sensor on OpenAQ, between `datetimeFirst` and `datetimeLast`, including
  minimum, maximum, average values.
