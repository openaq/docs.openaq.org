The Owners resource in the OpenAQ API provides information about the people or
organizations responsible for managing air quality monitoring stations and
instruments. Owners may include governmental agencies, research institutions,
other organizations that oversee air quality monitoring, and even individuals
who have installed an air quality monitoring device on their property. The data
“owner” may be the same as the data “provider” (see Providers).

## Purpose and Use

The Owners resource helps users identify who manages specific air quality
monitoring stations. Knowing the owner offers context about the individual or
organization behind the data collection, and to whom to attribute the data.

## Key fields

- id: a unique identifier for each owner.
- name: the name of the organization or individual responsible for managing the
  air monitoring location.
