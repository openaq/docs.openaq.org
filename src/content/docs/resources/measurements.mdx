The measurements resources in the OpenAQ API provides measurement values of from sensors.

## Purpose and Use

The manufacturers resource helps users find details about the companies behind
air quality monitoring devices. By linking manufacturers to specific
instruments, users can better understand the origins of the equipment collecting
air quality data. This is useful for assessing the reliability and background of
the instruments used for monitoring.

In addition to providing raw measurement values as reported by providers, the
API provides options for rolling up data into different aggregation periods.



### measurements

The measurements resource represents the measurement value as reported by the
upstream source

### hours

The hours resource is the hourly average (mean) value of measurements.

<Aside type="note" >
The vast majority of measurements on the OpenAQ platform are hourly values. In
the case where the upstream reporting period is hourly, the `hours` resource and
`measurements` resource will be the same.
</Aside>

### days

The days resource is the daily average (mean), computed from the hourly average
values from 01:00 to 0:00 in local time.

### months

The days resource is the daily average (mean), computed from the hourly average
values from 01:00 to 0:00 in local time.

### years

The years resource is the yearly average (mean), computed from the hourly
average values from January 01 at 01:00 to December 31 0:00 in local time.


additional aggregation is avaialable based and can be based on the above data
groups


<Aside type="caution" >
Aggregating from measurements, e.g. /v3/sensors/\{sensors_id\}/measurements/yearly,
can be computationally slow and may not resolve, resulting in a timeout error.
For most reliable results, limit queries to smaller time periods using the `date_from` and
`date_to` query parameters. 
</Aside>

### hourly
 
### daily

<Aside type="note" >
A call to the `/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/hours/daily` is functionally the same as
`/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/days`. The days options should be the preferred
resource.
