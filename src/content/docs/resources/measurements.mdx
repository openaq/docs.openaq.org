The measurements resources in the OpenAQ API provide measurement values from
sensors. Measurement values are available from a number of different resources
as their original values and different levels of aggregation.

## Purpose and Use

In addition to providing raw measurement values as reported by providers, the
API provides options for rolling up data into different aggregation periods.

### Summary

### Coverage

### Resources

#### measurements

`https://api.openaq.org/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/measurements`

The measurements resource represents the original measurement value as reported
by the upstream source.

#### hours

`https://api.openaq.org/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/hours`

The hours resource is the hourly average (mean) value of measurements.

<Aside type="note">
  Many sensors on the OpenAQ platform report hourly values. In the case where
  the upstream reporting period is hourly, the `hours` resource and
  `measurements` resource are equivalent.
</Aside>

#### days

`https://api.openaq.org/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/days`

The days resource is the daily average (mean), computed from the hourly average
values from 01:00 to 0:00 in local time.

#### years

`https://api.openaq.org/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/years`

The years resource is the yearly average (mean), computed from the hourly
average values from January 01 at 01:00 to December 31 0:00 in local time.

### Aggregation

Additional aggregation is available and can be based on the above data groups

<Aside type="caution" >
Aggregating from measurements, e.g. /v3/sensors/\{sensors_id\}/measurements/yearly,
can be computationally slow and may not resolve, resulting in a 408 Request Timeout error.
For most reliable results, limit queries to smaller time periods using the `date_from` and
`date_to` query parameters. 
</Aside>

#### hourly

`https://api.openaq.org/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/measurements/hourly`

<Aside type="note">
  A call to the `/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/measurements/hourly` is functionally
  the same as `/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/hours`. The `/hours` options should be
  the preferred resource.
</Aside>

#### daily

`https://api.openaq.org/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/measurements/hourly`

`https://api.openaq.org/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/hours/hourly`

<Aside type="note">
  A call to the `/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/hours/daily` is functionally the same
  as `/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/days`. The `/days` options should be the
  preferred resource.
</Aside>

#### monthly

`https://api.openaq.org/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/measurements/monthly`

`https://api.openaq.org/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/hours/monthly`

`https://api.openaq.org/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/days/monthly`

#### yearly

`https://api.openaq.org/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/measurements/yearly`

`https://api.openaq.org/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/hours/yearly`

`https://api.openaq.org/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/days/yearly`

#### Hour of day

`https://api.openaq.org/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/measurements/hourofday`

#### Day of week

`https://api.openaq.org/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/measurements/dayofweek`

`https://api.openaq.org/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/hours/dayofweek`

#### Month of year

`https://api.openaq.org/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/measurements/monthofyear`

`https://api.openaq.org/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/hours/monthofyear`

`https://api.openaq.org/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/days/monthofyear`

## Key fields:

- value - The average (mean) value in aggregate, except in the `measurements`
  resource `value` is the original reported measurement value.
- parameter - An object decribing the parameter measured by the sensor.
- period - An object that describes the period agreggate includes a label of the
  interval, the interval in hours, and a date range of the period aggregated.
- coordinates - The coordinates of the measurement value for mobile monitoring.
  `null` for stationary monitoring.
- summary - An object that provides summary statistics of the aggregated data.
  Includes mininimum, maximum, median and quartile values. This object will be
  null for `measurements`
- coverage - An object that provides coverage information of the aggregated
  data. Includes expected counts, observed count, percent complete and a date
  range for the values aggregated.
