The measurements resources in the OpenAQ API provide measurement values from
sensors. Measurement values are available from a number of different resources
as their original values and different levels of aggregation.

## Purpose and Use

In addition to providing raw measurement values as reported by providers, the
API provides options for rolling up data into different aggregation periods.

## Resources

### Measurements

`https://api.openaq.org/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/measurements`

The `measurements` resource is the original measurement value as
reported by the upstream source.

### Hours

`https://api.openaq.org/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/hours`

The `hours` resource is the hourly average (mean) value of measurements.

<Aside type="note">
  Many sensors on the OpenAQ platform report hourly values. In the case where
  the upstream reporting period is hourly, the `hours` resource and
  `measurements` resource are equivalent.
</Aside>

### Days

`https://api.openaq.org/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/days`

The `days` resource is the daily average (mean), computed from the hourly average
values from 01:00 to 0:00 in local time.

### Years

`https://api.openaq.org/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/years`

The `years` resource is the yearly average (mean), computed from the hourly
average values from January 01 at 01:00 to December 31 0:00 in local time.

### Aggregation Periods

Additional aggregation is available and can be based on the above data groups

<Aside type="caution" >
Aggregating from measurements, e.g. /v3/sensors/\{sensors_id\}/measurements/yearly,
can be computationally slow and may not resolve, resulting in a 408 Request Timeout error.
For most reliable results, limit queries to smaller time periods using the `date_from` and
`date_to` query parameters. 
</Aside>

### Hourly

`https://api.openaq.org/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/measurements/hourly`

The `hourly` aggregator returns the average (mean) value for each hour across
the selected time range.

<Aside type="note">
  A call to the `/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/measurements/hourly` is functionally
  the same as `/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/hours`. The `/hours` options is the
  preferred resource.
</Aside>

### Daily

`https://api.openaq.org/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/measurements/daily`

`https://api.openaq.org/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/hours/daily`

The `daily` aggregator returns the average (mean) value for each day across the
selected time range.

<Aside type="note">
  A call to the `/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/hours/daily` is functionally the same
  as `/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/days`. The `/days` options is the preferred
  resource.
</Aside>

### Monthly

`https://api.openaq.org/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/measurements/monthly`

`https://api.openaq.org/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/hours/monthly`

`https://api.openaq.org/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/days/monthly`

The `monthly` aggregator returns the average (mean) value for each month across
the selected time range.

### Yearly

`https://api.openaq.org/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/measurements/yearly`

`https://api.openaq.org/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/hours/yearly`

`https://api.openaq.org/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/days/yearly`

The `yearly` aggregator returns the average (mean) value for each year across
the selected time range.

<Aside type="note">
  A call to the `/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/hours/yearly` is functionally the same
  as `/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/years`. The `/years` options is the preferred
  resource.
</Aside>

### Hour of day

`https://api.openaq.org/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/hours/hourofday`

The `hourofday` aggregator returns the average (mean) value for each hour in a
24 hour day, across the selected time range. This allows analyzing air quality
trends on an hourly basis, offering insights into daily patterns and peak
pollution times, such as diurnal patterns.

### Day of week

`https://api.openaq.org/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/measurements/dayofweek`

`https://api.openaq.org/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/hours/dayofweek`

The `dayofweek` aggregator returns the average (mean) value for each day in a
week (Monday-Sunday), across the selected time range. This allows analyzing air
quality trends on an daily basis, offering insights into daily patterns and peak
pollution days.

### Month of year

`https://api.openaq.org/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/measurements/monthofyear`

`https://api.openaq.org/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/hours/monthofyear`

`https://api.openaq.org/v3/sensors/{sensors_id}/days/monthofyear`

The `monthofyear` aggregator returns the average (mean) value for each month in
a year (January-December), across the selected time range. This allows analyzing
air quality trends on an monthly basis, offering insights into seasonal
patterns.

## Response details

### Summary

The summary object provides summary statistics about a aggregated measurement
value. The object includes the minimum and maximum values, quartile values
(25th, 50th and 75th), average (mean), high percentile (98th) and low percentile
(2nd) and standard deviation. When requesting `measuremements` this field is
null.

```json
{
  "min": 0.001,
  "q02": 0.002,
  "q25": 0.025,
  "median": 0.033,
  "q75": 0.043,

  "avg": 0.03316917293233082,
  "sd": 0.013343557164562366
}
```

### Coverage

The coverage object provides information on the coverage of measurements when
aggregating values over time. When requesting `measuremements` this field is
will show `expectedCount` and `observedCount` values of 1, and `percentComplete`
of 100.

```json
{
  "expectedCount": 273,
  "expectedInterval": "273:00:00",
  "observedCount": 266,
  "observedInterval": "266:00:00",

    "local": "2024-10-01T03:00:00-06:00"
  }
}
```
