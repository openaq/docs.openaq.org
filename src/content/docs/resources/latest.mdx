title: Latest
---

The latest resource in the OpenAQ API provides the most recent air quality
measurement from a sensor. Each record provides the measurement time, value,
location coordinates, and sensor information. This resource helps users stay
updated on current air quality at specific locations.

## Purpose and Use

The latest resource offers access to the newest air quality data from sensors in
the OpenAQ system. It shows recent measurements and their geographic location,
allowing users to track air quality trends quickly and make timely decisions.

The latest resource is accessible through either a single [location](locations),
showing latest values for all sensors available at that location, or by
parameter, showing the latest value across all sensors that measure that
parameter. e.g.:

```url
https://api.openaq.org/v3/locations/2178/latest
```

or

```url
https://api.openaq.org/v3/parameters/2/latest
```

:::note The latest value does not represent the most recent measurement ingested
by OpenAQ for a given sensor, but instead represents the last measurement value
in the series. Due to the nature of how some upstream providers report data,
measurements are not necessarily reported in order. Polling latest resources for
measurement values does not guarantee complete data coverage as measurements may
be ingested out of their time series order and not show up as a "latest" value.

## Key Fields

- datetime: The time of the measurement, provided in UTC and local time. See
  [Dates, times and timezones](using-the-api/dates-datetimes) for more
  information.
- value: the sensor measurement reading.
- coordinates: The location in WGS84 latitude and longitude of the reading.
- sensorsId: Unique ID for the sensor that took the reading. See the
  [Sensors](resources/sensors) resource page for more information.
- locationsId: Unique ID for the location where the sensor is situated. See the
  [Locations](resources/locations) resource page for more information.
