title: Latest
---

The Latest resource in the OpenAQ API provides the most recent air quality
measurement from a sensor. Each record provides the measurement time, value,
location coordinates, and sensor information.

:::note  
The latest value does not represent the most recent measurement ingested by
OpenAQ for a given sensor, but instead represents the last measurement value in
the series. Due to the nature of how some upstream providers report data,
measurements are not necessarily reported in order. Polling latest resources for
measurement values does not guarantee complete data coverage as measurements may
be ingested out of their time series order and not show up as a "latest"
value.  
:::

## Purpose and Use

The Latest resource provides access to the newest air quality data from sensors.
It shows recent measurements and their geographic location, allowing users to
track air quality trends quickly and make timely decisions.

The Latest resource is accessible through either a single
[location](locations), showing latest values for all sensors available at
that location, or by parameter, showing the latest value across all sensors that
measure that parameter, e.g.:

```
https://api.openaq.org/v3/locations/2178/latest
```

or

```
https://api.openaq.org/v3/parameters/2/latest
```

:::note The latest value does not represent the most recent measurement ingested
by OpenAQ for a given sensor, but instead represents the last measurement value
in the series. Due to the nature of how some upstream providers report data,
measurements are not necessarily reported in order. Polling latest resources for
measurement values does not guarantee complete data coverage as measurements may
be ingested out of their time series order and not show up as a "latest" value.

## Key Fields

- datetime: the time of the measurement, provided in UTC and local time. See
  [Dates, times and timezones](using-the-api/dates-datetimes) for more
  information.
- value: the sensor measurement reading.
- coordinates: the location in WGS84 latitude and longitude of the reading.
- sensorsId: the unique ID for the sensor that took the reading. See the
  [Sensors](sensors) resource page for more information.
- locationsId: the unique ID for the location where the sensor is situated. See
  the [Locations](locations) resource page for more
  information.
