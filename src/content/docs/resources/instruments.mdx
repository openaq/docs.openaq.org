The instruments resource in the OpenAQ API provides information about air
quality measuring devices. These devices gather data for different locations and
are linked to various organizations, including government bodies, universities,
and private companies. Each instrument has details such as its name, type, and
the company that made it.

## Purpose and Use

The instruments resource helps users find and learn about the devices gathering
air quality data. This resource also highlights whether a device is used for
official air monitoring. By using the information, users can understand what
kind of devices gather data, which is useful when analyzing the reliability and
scope of the data.

## Key fields:

- id: A unique identifier for each instrument in the system.
- name: The name of the device (e.g., "Clarity Node-S" or "BAM 1020").
- isMonitor: A field showing if the device is used for official monitoring.
- manufacturer: Details about the company or organization that made the device,
  including its ID and name. See the [Manufacturers](resources/locations)
  resource page for more information.

These fields allow users to identify the devices behind the data they analyze,
offering more context about the air quality information on the platform.
