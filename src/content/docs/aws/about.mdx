## Bucket structure

The bucket root url is 

```
https://openaq-data-archive.s3.amazonaws.com/
```

The files are organized with the the following structure:

import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<FileTree>

- records
  - csv.gz
    - locationid=\{locationid\}
      - year=\{year\}
        - month=\{month\}
          - location-\{locationid\}-\{year\}\{month\}\{day\}.csv.gz
          - ...

</FileTree>


example file path:

```
/records/csv.gz/locationid=2178/year=2022/month=05/location-2178-20220503.csv.gz
```

### Prefixes

The prefix structure follows the [Apache Hive partitioning format](https://athena.guide/articles/hive-style-partitioning/) with key value pairing in the directory title i.e. `key=value`. Hive formatting is not used for the top two directories named `records` and `csv.gz`.

 `records`

Top level directory containing individual records from locations.

 `file format`

The file format of the data. Currently only `csv.gz` (gzip csv)

 `locationid={locationid}`

The OpenAQ id for the location, a numerical value, e.g. `location_id=42`

 `year={year}`

The four digit number of the year, e.g. `year=2022`

`month={month}`

The zero padded two digit number of the month, e.g. `month=02`

## Measurement File

Measurements are stored as csv (comma-separated values) compressed with gzip (csv.gz). The measurements file holds measurement values for all sensors for a given location on a given day. The file follows the following naming convention: 

`loc-{locationid}-{year}{month}{day}.{ext}`

### File structure

Data are stored in [narrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_and_narrow_data#Narrow) format with the following columns: 

| Column name | description                                                                                                    | example                   |

| unit        | unit of the parameter                                                                                          | µg/m³                     |
| value       | the decimal value of the measurement                                                                           | 42.2                      |

## SNS Notification

An AWS SNS Topic is available for subscribing to S3 object creation events.

SNS ARN:

```
arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:817926761842:openaq-data-archive-object_created
```

To learn more about how to subscribe to SNS topics, view the
[AWS SNS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-create-subscribe-endpoint-to-topic.html).

## Update frequency

Files are written 72 hours after the end of day, i.e. 0:00 for the given
location's timezone. Files may be retroactively patched if data are missing due
to fetching error or from historical data scrape.
