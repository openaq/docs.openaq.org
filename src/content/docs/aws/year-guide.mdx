This guide shows you how to download a relatively large amount of measurement data, one year of hourly measurements from a single location, from the Open Data on AWS bucket. 




import { Aside, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';



 Run the following command to copy all data from [location 2178](https://explore.openaq.org/locations/2178) during the year 2020 to a local directory named `data`:

```sh
aws s3 cp \
--no-sign-request \
--recursive \
s3://openaq-data-archive/records/csv.gz/locationid=2178/year=2020/ \
data
```
<Aside type="caution" title="Warning">
This will download over 350 files to your system, roughly 1.5 MB of data.
