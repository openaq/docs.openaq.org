This guide shows how to fetch data from the OpenAQ API. As an example, we will
retrieve location details for the "New Delhi" station in New Delhi, India, with
OpenAQ location ID 8118.

This tutorial uses the AWS CLI to make requests and assumes you are familiar with
using the command line on your computer. The AWS CLI is not a
requirement for using the Open Data on AWS bucket but it does provide easy
access to AWS APIs necessary for communicating with the bucket.

<Steps>

1. Install and configure the AWS CLI from https://aws.amazon.com/cli/.
Configure the AWS config file, found at $HOME/.aws/confg, with the 

    ```ini
    // .aws/config
    [default]
    region = us-east-1
    output = json
    ```
    <Aside type="note" >

    The AWS config file must be configured to the `us-east-1` region to access the
    bucket.
    </Aside>

2. Test that the AWS CLI is installed an configured by running `aws --version`
in your command prompt. If version details show, `aws` exists and is configured
on your system.

3. Run the following command to copy a single day of data from
[location 2178](https://explore.openaq.org/locations/2178) to a local directory
named `data`:

    ```sh
    aws s3 cp \
    --no-sign-request \
    s3://openaq-data-archive/records/csv.gz/locationid=2178/year=2022/month=05/location-2178-20220503.csv.gz \
    data
    ```
    <Aside type="note" >

    `--no-sign-request` allows you to make the request without user credentials
    </Aside>

6. Now with the data file on your local system, unzip the file to reveal the csv
file with the following command.

    ```sh
    tar -xvzf \
    data/records/csv.gz/locationid=2178/year=2022/month=05/location-2178-20220503.csv.gz
    ```

</Steps>
