1. Install and configure the AWS CLI
    https://aws.amazon.com/cli/

    ```ini
    // .aws/config
    [default]
    region = us-east-1
    output = json
    ```

2. Test that the AWS CLI is installed an configured by running `aws --version` in your command prompt. If version details show, `aws` exists and if configured on your system.

3. To copy all data from [location 2178](https://explore.openaq.org/locations/2178) during the year 2020 to a local directory named `data`:

    ```sh
    aws s3 cp \
    --no-sign-request \
    --recursive \
    s3://openaq-data-archive/records/csv.gz/locationid=2178/year=2020/ \
