OpenAQ labels monitoring locations with a country label based on the
[Natural Earth Admin 0](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/) 10m dataset v5.1.2.
These boundaries may not be able to correctly label every station and may
require manual or "fuzzy" matching due to the coarse precision of the data and
differences in the precision of reported coordinates.

OpenAQ uses the country label from the Natural Earth dataset to label monitoring
locations in a consistent way. This is intended only to provide some an
approximated country label to ease the discovery of data. Definitions of
international boundaries can be complex, dependent on worldview, and politically
polarizing. The use of these boundaries does not constitute or imply their
endorsement by OpenAQ. Read more about Natural Earthâ€™s disputed boundaries
