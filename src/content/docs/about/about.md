title: About the API
---

The OpenAQ API provides open access to global air quality data, following REST
principles with resource-oriented URLs, standard HTTP response codes, and
JSON-formatted responses. You can retrieve real-time and historical measurements
for criteria pollutants, including particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>,
PM<sub>10</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>),
sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), among others. The API also hosts data on
additional pollutants from various sources.

All data accessed through the API is public, reinforcing OpenAQâ€™s commitment to
transparency and its mission to provide universal access to air quality data for
a healthier world.

To get started, explore the available endpoints and consult the documentation
for guidance.
