This guide shows how to fetch data from the OpenAQ API. As an example, we will
retrieve location details for the "New Delhi" station in New Delhi, India, with
OpenAQ location ID 8118.

This tutorial uses curl to make HTTP requests and assumes you are familiar with
using the command line on your computer.

<Steps>

1.  Run `curl --version` in the command line to see if curl exists on your
    machine. If version details show, curl exists. If you see
    `command not found: curl`, download and install it. For more details, visit
    the curl download page at https://curl.se/download.html.

2.  Sign up for an OpenAQ API key at https://explore.openaq.org. After signing
    up, find your API key in your settings. Use this key to authenticate
    requests.

        <Aside type="caution">
        Treat your API key as you would a password. Do not share your API key with
        others. If your API key leaks, you can request a new one in your OpenAQ
        Explorer account.
        </Aside>

3.  Run the following `curl` command, including your API key in the `X-API-Key`
    header. Replace `YOUR-OPENAQ-API-KEY` with your API key (placeholder value
    will not work).

        ```sh
        curl --request GET \
        --url "https://api.openaq.org/v3/locations/8118" \
        --header "X-API-Key: YOUR-OPENAQ-API-KEY"
        ```

4.  The JSON response will give you the data for location 8118. You have now
    used the OpenAQ API successfully.
