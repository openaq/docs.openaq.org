Libraries can simplify and enhance the way your application connects with the
OpenAQ API by providing pre-built code tailored to specific programming
environments. Once integrated into your project, these libraries allow you to
interact with the OpenAQ API more efficiently and consistently.

## Official OpenAQ libraries

OpenAQ maintains an official client library, the Python SDK. This library is the
recommended tool for most developers when interacting with the OpenAQ API. It
provides a standardized interface that simplifies integration and ensures that
developers are following best practices. By using this libary, developers can
more easily access the full range of OpenAQ's features and data, and benefit
from a consistent, well-documented approach that aligns with the latest updates
and functionalities of the API.
