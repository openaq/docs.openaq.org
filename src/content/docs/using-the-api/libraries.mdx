Libraries can simplify and enhance the way your application connects with the
OpenAQ API by providing pre-built code tailored to specific programming
environments. Once integrated into your project, these libraries allow you to
interact with the OpenAQ API more efficiently and consistently.

## Official OpenAQ libraries

OpenAQ maintains official client libraries for interacting with the OpenAQ API
with different programming language including the Python and R. These libraries
are the recommended tool for most developers when interacting with the OpenAQ
API. These tools provides a standardized interface that simplifies integration
and ensures that developers are following best practices. By using these
libraries developers can more easily access the full range of OpenAQ's features
and data, and benefit from a consistent, well-documented approach that aligns
with the latest updates and functionalities of the API.
