title: Dates, times and timezones
description:
  Learn how the OpenAQ API handles dates, times, and timezones, following the
  ISO-8601 format. Understand the distinction between dates and datetimes, and
  ensure accurate data interpretation with timezone considerations for global
  air quality measurements.

### Datetimes

Dates and datetimes in the OpenAQ API follow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="display: inline-flex;">ISO-8601<Icon name="external"/></a> datetime
format, e.g., `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSSZ`.

Data on OpenAQ are harmonized to follow an exclusive time-ending standard. This
means a time stamp for an hourly measurement 03:00 represents the data from
02:00 until 02:59.

### Dates

Dates represent the start of a time period. For example, a date like 2024-01-01
represents January 1, 2024, and a year like 2024-01-01 represents the calendar
year, 2024. This contrasts (see above) with how OpenAQ handles datetimes, where
they represent the end of a time period. In other words, while a _date_ marks
the start of a specific day or year, a _datetime_ indicates when that period has
concluded. This distinction is crucial for accurately interpreting the data
retrieved from the OpenAQ API, as it ensures clarity in understanding when data
collection periods begin and end.

### Timezones

Handling time zones correctly is crucial due to the global nature of the
dataset, which includes air quality data from monitoring stations across
different time zones. When requesting data from the OpenAQ API, timestamps
should ideally include a timezone in the ISO-8601 format (e.g.,
2024-08-25T15:00:00Z for UTC time). This ensures that the data retrieved
accurately reflects the time it was recorded, regardless of the station's
location. If a timezone is not provided in the timestamp, the API automatically
assumes the local time for the station where the data was collected. This
default behavior is important to understand as it can affect data comparisons
across different regions and time zones.

To ensure timezones are clearly represented in results, the API returns a
datetime object which includes both UTC time and local time.

```json
{
  "utc": "2019-07-11T20:00:00Z",
  "local": "2019-07-11T14:00:00-06:00"
}
```

The OpenAQ API provides the timezone ID string for a given monitoring location
under the `timezone` key. This follows the tzid in the <a href="https://www.iana.org/time-zones" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="display:inline-flex;">Time Zone Database <Icon name="external" /></a>
