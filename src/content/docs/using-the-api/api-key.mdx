The OpenAQ API uses API keys to authenticate requests and manage access. These
keys help control usage and enforce rate limits, ensuring that the service
remains available and responsive for all users.

## Managing Your API Key

Sign up at <a href="https://explore.openaq.org/register" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="display: inline-flex;">https://explore.openaq.org/register <Icon name="external" /></a>to get your API key. You can access and rotate your key from the OpenAQ Explorer
account settings page <a href="https://explore.openaq.org/account" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="display: inline-flex;"> explore.openaq.org/account <Icon name="external" /></a>.

<Aside type="caution">
Treat your API key as you would a password. Do not share your API key
with others. If your API key leaks, you can request a new one in your OpenAQ
Explorer account.
</Aside>

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `X-API-Key` header of each request. For example:

```sh
curl --request GET \
--url "https://api.openaq.org/v3/locations/2178" \
--header "X-API-Key: YOUR-OPENAQ-API-KEY"
```

Replace `YOUR-OPENAQ-API-KEY` with your actual key. This key verifies your
requests and ensures they are processed.
