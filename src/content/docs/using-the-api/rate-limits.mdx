OpenAQ limits the number of API requests you can make in a set time to ensure
fair access for all users and prevent overuse.

OpenAQ provides a very generous rate limit. If your needs exceed this rate
limit, we offer a custom pricing option for a higher rate limit.

If a rate limit is exceeded, the API returns a 429 "Too many requests" HTTP
status code. To continue, wait until the next rate limit period starts as
described in OpenAQâ€™s rate limit policy. Avoid making more requests during this
time to prevent further errors.

<Aside type="caution">
Exceeding API rate limits repeatedly can lead to either a temporary
or permanent ban from the OpenAQ API. To maintain uninterrupted access, plan
your API requests carefully.

## Rate limit headers

The OpenAQ API includes response headers to help you manage request rates and
adhere to limits. These headers give information about your current request
usage, remaining capacity, and reset times, allowing you to plan your API calls
effectively.

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="white-space: nowrap;">
        <code>x-ratelimit-used</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        Shows the number of requests that have been made during the current rate
        limit period. This header helps users track their usage and avoid
        exceeding limits.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="white-space: nowrap;">
        <code>x-ratelimit-reset</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        Provides a timestamp indicating when the rate limit period will reset.
        This header helps users plan when to start making requests again.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="white-space: nowrap;">
        <code>x-ratelimit-limit</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        Specifies the maximum number of requests allowed within the current rate
        limit period. This header helps users understand the upper bound for the
        number of requests they can make.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="white-space: nowrap;">
        <code>x-ratelimit-remaining</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        Indicates the number of requests remaining before reaching the rate
        limit. This header helps users avoid hitting the limit and encountering
        rate limit errors.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Example headers

```sh {5-8}
HTTP/2 200
content-type: application/json
content-length: 1681
date: Sat, 24 Aug 2024 21:20:25 GMT
x-ratelimit-used: 1
x-ratelimit-reset: 60
x-ratelimit-limit: 10
x-ratelimit-remaining: 9
...
```

In the example HTTP response above, the rate limit headers reveal:

- You can make a total of 10 requests in this period.
- You have used 1 request so far.
- You have 9 requests remaining before reaching the limit.
- The limit will reset in 60 seconds, at which point the request count will
  start over.
