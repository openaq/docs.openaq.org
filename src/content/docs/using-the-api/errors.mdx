The OpenAQ API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the outcome of API
requests, whether successful or erroneous. A successful request is accompanied
by a 200 "OK" status code that confirms the operation was completed as expected.
In cases of errors, the API responds with specific status codes that signify
different types of issues. These codes enable developers to quickly understand
and address any problems that arise when using the API.
